My name is sidhartha kumar padhy , i'm from odisha(Ganjam-berhampur).
I did my completed graduation in odisha in 2021 and also completed my 12th and 10th class in odisha.
My 12th class passing year is 2017 and 10th class passing year is 2015.  
My graduation is computer science and engineering in B-TECH. 
My B-tech project title is "---------cluster based localization scheme with backup node in underwater wireless sensor network--------". 
B-TECH Project's year of completion is 2020-2021 .  
I'm a fresher.  



----------------------------------------------------------------B-TECH PROJECT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------Cluster based localization scheme with backup node in underwater wireless sensor network------------------------------------------- 

OVERVIEWS: 

  The solution is designed using matlab . 
  ---------------------------------------project will be as follows-----------------------------------------------------------
  step 1->  Matlab Simulation of a network field with some sensor nodes placed randomly.
  step 2->  We required finding out the clusters and clustering head.
  step 3->  By getting the information from the cluster head, it require  to  find out  every nodes  location  information.
  step 4->  Find out the efficiency of project by comparing with other existing method.
  

NOTE : ------- GIVEN ABOVE SOURCE CODES OF MATLAB.------------------
